## About
Hello! I'm a passionate and detail-oriented professional with a background in pharmacy, now embarking on a journey into the world of data analysis. 

With a solid foundation in pharmacy, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis, combining strong analytical skills with a deep understanding of healthcare processes. 

Eager to apply my skills in a new context, I am currently honing my expertise in data analysis through Codecademy lessons and building my portfolio.

Whether you are an experienced data analyst, industry expert, or someone with insights into the transition process, I would love to connect and learn from your experiences.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Projects

### Creating Visualisations of Top Movies Dataset

**Link:** [Link to Dashboard on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/TopMovies_17144940892630/Attributes?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Goal:** To create visualisations of findings in the dataset.

**Skills:** data visualisation.

**Technology:** Tableau.

**Results:** Created a dashboard of visualisations from a csv file we had previously obtained using an API.

### Scraping movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) public APIs

**Code:** [Top Movies](https://github.com/eleanorpartington/portfolio/blob/main/Top%20Movies.ipynb)

**Goal:** To create a DataFrame of top movies by average votes from users.

**Skills:** data gathering, data cleaning.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, JSON, Requests.

**Results:** Using Python functions we have saved a csv file of the top movies from the TMDB website ready for analysis. 

### Analysing the average GDP against average the Life Expectancy across six Countries

**Code:** [GDP and Life Expectancy](https://github.com/eleanorpartington/portfolio/blob/main/project%20gdp.ipynb)

**Goal:** To examine the change in GDP and Life expectancy over time and any correlations between them.

**Skills:** data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed which countries had the highest GDP and Life Expectancy values and which countries had the strongest correlation between GDP and Life Expectancy.

### Analysing Species

**Code:** [Biodiversity](https://github.com/eleanorpartington/portfolio/blob/main/biodiversity.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyse species by their conservation status, category and number of observations across four locations.

**Skills:** data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions presented the species represented in the dataframes focusing on their observations alongside the proportions of protected species and species categories. It also showed where species were most commonly observed.
