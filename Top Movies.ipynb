    "I am going to create a DataFrame of the top 50 pages of Movies ordered by average voted score listed using an API from TMDB. I will also then clean the DataFrame, checking for duplicates, appropriate data types, and null values before saving it as a csv file ready for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "My aim is to create repeatable code that can save a DataFrame to analyse at a later date, doing this also allows me to conduct analysis seperate to the data collection, and also allows me to conduct multiple rounds of data collection and analyse differences in voted score over time.\n",

    " ## Setting up the API\n",
    " \n",
    " After going onto the TMDB website and signed up to gain an authorization code to be able to use the API, I started off with the basic API request script provided for the Top Movies list endpoint. I modified the query parameters to sort the movies by the average score voted (giving us the top movies by *vote_average*), where the average vote was greater than 7.5, and there was at least 300 votes that made up the score. I also chose to exclude *documentary* and *TV Movie* genres.\n",
    " \n",
    " When running the query against the API endpoint, we can see that it returns 20 movies per page. I created a `for` loop to get all the top 50 pages of movies. Within the `for` loop, we convert the json response into a dictionary. We then insert each movie from the response into a `movies` dictionary using the *tmdb_id* as the key. By doing this, we are able to deduplicate the data we receive. It is possible for this to happen if ratings change in between our requests to the API. After the data collection, we turn the `movies` dictionary into a list for easier consumption.\n",
    " \n",
    " As this is a lot to ask the TMDB server to send us, we have added a sleep query of 0.025 seconds between each request since they have stated on their [website](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/rate-limiting) that they accept up to around 50 requests per second with this subject to change. Therefore our 0.025 second break means that we are requesting up to a maximum of 40 requests per second. Getting 50 pages could take a while, so on each loop I print which page it has requested so we have a visual track of how the request is going. "

In contradiction, when running this, I have seen Whiplash from 2013 and 2014, the 2013 movie is a short film. Also, Miracle in Cell No7 from 2013 and 2019, the 2013 version is the original Korean version and the 2019 versian is an Indonesian adaption. When we begin analysis, it would be important to manually review these duplicates and finding further details about the movies such as runtimes and original language to decide whether we want to include these movies.\n",

We can see that the *tmdb_id* and *vote_count* are whole numbers, *average_score* and *popularity_score* are numbers, *movie_title* and *genres* are objects and *release_date* are datetimes.
